        <h2>Description</h2>
        <br>
            <p>Gordon Ramsay's breakfast classic is the ideal way to begin an indulgent weekend</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>4 large free-range eggs</li>
            <li>2 toasting muffins</li>
            <li>1 batch hot hollandaise sauce (see 'Goes well with' below)</li>
            <li>4 slices parma ham</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a deep saucepan of water to the boil (at least 2 litres) and add 3 tbsp white wine vinegar. Break the eggs into four separate coffee cups or ramekins. Split the muffins, toast them and warm some plates.</li>
            <li>Swirl the vinegared water briskly to form a vortex and slide in an egg. It will curl round and set to a neat round shape. Cook for 2-3 mins, then remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the other eggs, one at a time, re-swirling the water as you slide in the eggs. Spread some sauce on each muffin, scrunch a slice of ham on top, then top with an egg. Spoon over the remaining hollandaise and serve at once.</li>
        </ol>
